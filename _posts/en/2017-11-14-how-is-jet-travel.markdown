There's nothing this jet cannot do. Unmatched comfort in the cabin and a great ambiance are some of the characteristics of the Hawker 700A that elevate comfort levels to unseen heights. The perfect equilibrium to cover any and all expectations that a traveler will ever need.

Its technological equipment is rated as the top of its class, while its luxury and comfort simply cannot be any better. The cabin space is wide, more so than any mid-sized category jet. It is an amazing match of comfort and luxury. With its impeccable security history, the Hawker 700A is entrepeneurs and travelers top choice for flights, more than any other craft. Due to the height of its cabin you won't have a problem standing up in any moment during your flight. An elegant fusion of features and comfort, with a 5 hours flight autonomy and a maximum speed of 830 km/h, the Hawker 700, mid-sized aircraft, can seat 9 people without problems. The 700 has an exceptional compartment for luggage, so you take any equipment you may need to your destination.
