Whis is better? Buying or renting a plane? According to the experts, it depends on your needs and specially, on your budget.

Francisco Zozaya, director of Aerolíneas Ejecutivas, considered that, before buying an any aircraft, it is necessary to ponder costs and benefits. He suggested that is a company or executive needs 300 flight hours a year, purchasing a plane is justified.

If yearly flying time is less, it's better to rent, Zozaya argued.

“A shoe company in León, with stores in all the country, can easily visit 5 cities or stores; it can visit the entire northside of the country in 2 days, instead of waiting for the slower frequency of a commercial flight”, Zozaya stated.

Currently, pre-owned jets that are younger than 10 years are a viable option, and they range between 3 and 15 million dollars.

Some of them might be valued 39 million dollars. Additional costs are: planes maintenance, hangar rent and tripulation.

In Mexico, every year, around 120 executive planes are available yearly in the market, with fluctuations of around 10%. From all the aircraft available, 80% are pre-owned and only 20% are new.

In this segment, the Bombardier, Embraer, Benchcraft and Hondajet have a solid presence, via representation.
