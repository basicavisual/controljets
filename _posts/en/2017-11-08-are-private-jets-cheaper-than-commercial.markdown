This is a question that travel enthusiasts think a lot about: "Can a ticket in a private flight be in the same price range than a commercial flight?"

To which we reply: “Not often, but sometimes.”

You must take into account, however, that passengers that opt for private aviation seldom take cheap offers into consideration. For most, it's more about flexibility, time saving, space, comfort and privacy protection.

For all these reasons, the private jet is preferred by people with a high purchasing power that what can be offered by regular airlines. However, in some circumstances, it can even be cheaper to flight private.

And indeed, even though the total cost of a private flight is generally higher, a lot of people are surprised of the price per person in comparison to a commercial flight ticket. Sometimes, the cost of a private flight is even near to the cost of flying first class or even a budget airline ticket.

When you rent a private jet, the price shown is always in the form of capital. The cost per passenger on a flight depends on the amount of people transported. If every seat is occupied, it will obviously be lower than the cost of flying a single person.

These are some examples in which the two options are comparable:



### INDIRECT FLIGHTS
A lot of flight routes can't be done without one stop at least, which significantly elevates the total cost of the the travel.

On the other hand, a private jet can flight can flight directly between the 2 points of departure and arrival. Hence, a private jet flight can be cheaper and the traveler will spend less time flying this way.



### “ULTRA FIRST CLASS”
Private “Ultra First Class” sections are a new kind of travel offered by airlines that want to compete with private aviation. They are certainly full of luxury, but they don't offer the possibility of flying on your own schedule. Even the most exclusive airlines impose strict timings, transporting travelers massively in the biggest aircraft possible, and only towards high traffic airports.

The main advantage of private aviation is your capacity to travel at your convenience, besides tranquility and discretion. Everything is à la carte: schedules, itinerary, on board entertainment, catering, etc.



### EMPTY FLIGHTS
Of all the advice you will get to reduce costs on private travel, getting on an empty flight is the best.

The price on empty flights tends to be cheaper than regular airline tickets, but you must take into account that these type of flights tend to have heavy schedule and availability restrictions. In order to really get the benefits from them, you better have a flexible schedule at work.

Most of those empty flights are one-way flights so you regularly must combine them with commercial flights to get to your original departure point.
